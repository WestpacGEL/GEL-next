Error messages are triggered when the user either navigates to the next page in a process, submits the form or confirms an action.&nbsp;The system checks the data entered and identifies where it needs attention, such as incomplete mandatory fields, or incorrect formatting.&nbsp;

Errors can also be triggered instantly as the user moves from one field to the next, also known as ‘onBlur’, but not all validation can be consistently performed in this way, requiring errors to be triggered again on submit. &nbsp;

Error messages can appear in two places:&nbsp;

1. Descriptive [Alert text](/components/alert) message that sits with the field in error&nbsp;
1. Page level [Alert box](/components/alert) error summary that sits at the top of the page. The summary lists the errors on the page and anchor links to each. This is only triggered when the user tries to proceed to the next screen while there are active errors.&nbsp;

The summary is a useful feature for all users, as it acts as a second method of exposing error messages and it provides a path forward when someone tries to leave a page with active errors. It is also crucial for accessibility, as it maximises the discoverability of errors on the page in a way that is important for a variety of user groups, such as screen reader users and people with cognitive impairments.&nbsp;
