When communicating with users, it's crucial to use clear, simple language without jargon. This ensures that everyone can easily understand the content. Help text needs to be used sparingly, it should not appear with every question. &nbsp;

However, there are some situations where you have no choice but to provide some extra guidance:&nbsp;

- **Explaining jargon and acronyms:** Sometimes you have to use complex terms and acronyms which may be unfamiliar to users. &nbsp;
- **Providing context:** We may sometimes have to ask questions that might not seem relevant to the process, it can be useful to provide additional context or background information to help users understand the significance and purpose of the question. i.e. *Why are we asking you this?* &nbsp;
- **Addressing FAQs:** Sometimes our users have common queries about certain aspects of a process. Quickly answering those questions can give the user confidence and keep them on track.&nbsp;
