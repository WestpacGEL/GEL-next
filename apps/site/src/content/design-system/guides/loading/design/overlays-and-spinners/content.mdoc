The most common page loading pattern is a simple, animated spinning icon on a page overlay. This approach prevents the user from interacting with the content on the screen by covering the entire page including headers, footers or any other navigation. The loading animation should be accompanied by messaging that explains what is happening and why the user is waiting. The message can change based on how long the system is taking.

### Spinner vs animation

Depending on the process or the audience, instead of showing a simple spinner, the system can display a more complex and potentially engaging animation. This is usually reserved for customer facing processes. These animations can be visually specific to the actual process.
