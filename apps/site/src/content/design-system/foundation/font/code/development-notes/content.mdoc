If the brand font is a web font (not a system font) then it should be self-hosted and implemented using the @fontface declaration. Suitable fallbacks should also be declared in the font stack.

Developers can [download web font files](https://westpacgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/O365-UG-043642/EmCGwWc6TtVKrkd39ZL2lZMBK06NWlIvAl2wA3uOa4gnTQ) directly from SharePoint.

After downloading the font files, developers should follow the installation instructions outlined [here](/design-system/wbc/development/get-started) to add them to their project.
