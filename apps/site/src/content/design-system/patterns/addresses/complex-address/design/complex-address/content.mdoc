### Base pattern

The Complex manual address pattern was born out of a platform requirement to facilitate the capture of multiple property types. By answering the property type question, users can then be served the correct corresponding fields.

```tsx
<div className="w-full lg:w-7/12">
  <ComplexAddressDemo />
</div>
```
