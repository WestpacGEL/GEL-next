### Base pattern

The Tax File Number (TFN) pattern uses progressive disclosure as to allow the user to match their preferences and not overwhelm with too many questions at once.

```tsx
<div className="w-full sm:w-7/12">
  <TaxFileNumberPattern />
</div>
```

### Previously provided

This variation includes an option to select a TFN that has been provided previously, this is for existing customers.

```tsx
<div className="w-full sm:w-7/12">
  <TaxFileNumberPattern showPrevious />
</div>
```
