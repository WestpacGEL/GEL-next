No full stops at the end of any headings but fine to use a full stop or comma to break up a headline.

For example:

> OUR DREAM RATE JUST GOT DREAMIER
> 
> LIFE IS EVENTFUL. THAT’S WHY WE HELP
> 
> MEET RED, YOUR VIRTUAL ASSISTANT

---

Question marks and exclamation marks can help keep headings short and engaging.

For example:

> WANT $3K CASHBACK?

*Note: Only use exclamation marks when appropriate, e.g. Now that’s a great rate!*
