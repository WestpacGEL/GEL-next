Days and months are spelt out in full unless appearing in T&Cs, disclaimers, contact details or mobile apps.

For example:

> Monday, January
>
> Apply by 1 Jan 2021.
>
> Mon–Sun

---

Dates should appear as <Day>, <Date><Month><Year>

For example:

> Monday, 1 January 2021

_Note: For T&Cs and disclaimers, shorten dates as DD/MM/YY or 1 Jan 2021._

---

Don’t use ‘st’, ‘nd’, ‘rd’, ‘th’ on dates.

For example:

> Do: 25 January 2021
>
> Don’t: 25th January 2021

---

No apostrophes on decades – it’s plural, not possessive.

For example:

> 1990s, 90s

---

For date/day/time ranges, use an em dash with no space on either side.

For example:

> 10–15 January 2021
>
> 2010–2020
>
> Mon–Fri
>
> 8am–8pm

---

For times, use the 12-hour clock and use full stops to separate hours and minutes.

For example:

> Do: 8.30am, 5.30pm
>
> Don’t: 8.00am, 8:00am, 17.30

_Note: For 12am and 12pm, use ‘midnight’ and ‘noon’._

For example:

> Entries closes before midnight.
>
> The event will start at noon.

---

If you need to specify the time zone, use the following format:

- Westpac

  8.30am-5pm (Sydney time), Mon-Fri

- St George

Mon-Sat, 8am-8pm (AEST)

- Bank of Melbourne

Mon-Sat, 8am-8pm

- BankSA

Mon-Sat, 7.30am-7.30pm

---

Use 24/7 – not ‘24 hours, 7 days a week’.

For example:

> Bank online, 24/7
>
> You can call us anytime, 24/7

---

When writing for mobile apps, the guidance for dates and times are:

- Date can be qualified as today, yesterday or tomorrow

For example:

> today, yesterday, tomorrow

- Date cannot be qualified as today, yesterday or tomorrow

For example:

> Fri 1 Mar 2022

- Date with time

For example:

> Fri 1 Mar 2022 11:50pm (Sydney time)

---

Numbers 0 to 9 are generally written as words while numbers 10+ are generally written as numerals.

For example:

> No monthly fees for six months.
>
> Our lowest rate in 20 years.

---

Use numerals instead of words for:

- business days
- age
- school years
- dates and business days
- street addresses
- tips articles
- instructions
- snappy copy
- mobile apps where space is limited.

For example:

> Your new card will arrive within 5 business days
>
> Children under 5 years old…
>
> Year 12 students

---

Avoid starting a headline or sentence with a numeral unless it’s dollar amounts, percentages, points or tips/reasons/steps, etc.

For example:

> $3k cashback when you refinance your home loan to us.
>
> 1.99% p.a. fixed rate for first home buyers.
>
> 150,000 Velocity Points could be yours with a Westpac home loan.
>
> 5 tips for paying off your mortgage faster.
>
> 3 easy steps to setting up Online Banking.
