Writing in a clear, simple way promotes equal access to information, creating a society where no one is left behind.  As a guide, our content needs to be understood by a 13 year old to cater for people who have a basic understanding of legal and financial language and who use English as a second language, as well as those with an intellectual or learning disability. Some common things to consider when writing for a diverse audience include:

- spelling [acronyms](/content/guidelines/acronym) in full when they’re first mentioned.
- writing [link copy that provides context](/content/guidelines/hyperlinks-email-addresses) instead of using ‘click here’.
- [avoid using terms that assumes the way a person interacts with something](/content/guidelines/calls-to-action-ctas), for example, ‘walk’, ‘simply’, ‘see’ or ‘watch’.
