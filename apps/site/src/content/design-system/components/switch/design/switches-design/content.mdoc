**Sizes:** We have one simple switch style that is available in four sizes (heights), with the default being Medium 36px. These four sizes align with other form element sizes.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
  <Switch size="small" label="Small 30px" />
  <Switch label="Medium 36px" />
  <Switch size="large" label="Large 42px" />
  <Switch size="xlarge" label="X Large 48px" />
</div>
```

**Block switches:** Use Block switches in small break points to align the label and element to either side of the screen. This behaviour can be set up to work responsively, and change depending on breakpoint.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <Switch block label="eStatements" />
  <Switch block label="Quick balance" />
</div>
```

**Using responsive breakpoint control:** As well as determining if the switch is a Block switch, the switch's size can also change based on breakpoint.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <em className="typography-body-10 mb-2">Medium size switch becomes Extra large from the MD breakpoint</em>
  <Switch block size={{ initial: 'medium', md: 'xlarge' }} label="Medium → Extra large" />

  <hr className="border-border my-4" />
  <em className="typography-body-10 mb-2">Extra large size switch becomes small from the SM breakpoint</em>
  <Switch block size={{ initial: 'xlarge', sm: 'small' }} label="Extra large → Small" />

  <hr className="border-border my-4" />
  <em className="typography-body-10 mb-2">
    Small size switch becomes medium at the SM breakpoint, large at the MD breakpoint and Extra large at the LG
    breakpoint
  </em>
  <Switch
    block
    size={{ initial: 'small', sm: 'medium', md: 'large', lg: 'xlarge' }}
    label="Small → Medium → Large → Extra large"
  />
</div>
```
