- An indicator outline appears around the input, select or button when focused via a keyboard or assistive technology
- Input group includes an option to visually hide the label
- The input group shape and text content is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode (WHCM). Button ‘look’ styling (colour) is not visible in WHCM.

### Accessibility in the HTML

- `<label htmlFor="{ID}">` Input group has the option of having a visually hidden label element and uses explicit association for optimal support in assistive technologies. [React component: refer to srOnly prop, id is auto-generated]
- `<input type="text" id="{ID}"> / <select id="{ID}">` Text input or select elements must have a unique id value. [React component: id is auto-generated but can be overwritten using instanceId property]
