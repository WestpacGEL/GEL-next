Modals are configurable. Choose how they are dismissed, whether they have a footer, or what the footer contains. Modals can house whatever content you require of them, allowing you to define your experience. Make sure you always provide a clear way forward. Select from the buttons below to view the modals.

```jsx
() => {
  const noFooterState = useOverlayTriggerState({});
  const noDismissState = useOverlayTriggerState({});

  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center gap-2">
      <Modal state={noFooterState} title="Modal title" isDismissable onClose={noFooterState.close}>
        <ModalBody>
          <p>
            The line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky, and in one particular quarter it showed black
            against a silvery climbing phosphorescence that grew and grew.
          </p>
        </ModalBody>
      </Modal>
      <Button soft look="primary" onClick={noFooterState.open}>
        No footer
      </Button>
      <Modal isKeyboardDismissDisabled state={noDismissState} title="Modal title">
        <ModalBody>
          <p>
            The line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky, and in one particular quarter it showed black
            against a silvery climbing phosphorescence that grew and grew.
          </p>
        </ModalBody>
        <ModalFooter
          primaryLabel="Label"
          primaryOnClick={noDismissState.close}
          secondaryLabel="Close"
          secondaryOnClick={noDismissState.close}
        />
      </Modal>
      <Button soft look="primary" onClick={noDismissState.open}>
        No dismiss button
      </Button>
    </div>
