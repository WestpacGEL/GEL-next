- Avoid using too much content and consider smaller viewports when designing responsive web apps.
- Avoid changing the styles of Tabs and Accordions (border, colour, size etc )
- Do use Tabs and Accordions on any background (light or dark).
- Avoid making Tab and Accordion labels too long. Although they will wrap the interface will become cluttered very quickly.
