The Tabcordion component has three modes:

1. **Tabset**&nbsp;– traditional horizontal tabs, allowing only one content panel to be visible at a time, by selecting the relevant tab.
1. **Accordion**&nbsp;– collapsible content containers, allowing multiple content panels to be visible simultaneously, by selecting the relevant bar.
1. **Tabcordion**&nbsp;– a responsive combination of the first two.

The first two modes function in the traditional way. The third ‘Tabcordion’ is the term we use to describe a responsive tab set. When using a Tabset in our web applications we typically experience layout issues when the application needs to display on small viewports (phones). Often the tabs won’t fit horizontally in the limited screen size. To remedy this problem, we developed the Tabcordion where the Tabset will turn into an Accordion when viewed on smaller devices (phones).

This component is useful when trying to simplify and group content for users to view when they need it, as opposed to displaying everything at once.
