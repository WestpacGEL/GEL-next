Tabset, Accordions and Tabcordions, can have one of two styles applied to them&nbsp;*Default*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*Lego*:

The&nbsp;**Default style**&nbsp;is designed to be subtle and understated while still providing a clear indication of which tab or accordion bar is selected, and its related content. To further reinforce this relationship a transition is used to display related content when a tab or accordion bar is selected. Generous padding provides a larger hit area and important breathing space to provide emphasis without adding noise.

The&nbsp;**Lego tabset**&nbsp;is designed to be more prominent. This design came out of a project request for a more emphasised component which would also add some brand colour to an otherwise dry, text heavy interface.

Tab sets and accordions are intended to visually group related content. When used correctly with moderate content they do this extremely well. However, if too much content is used it becomes difficult to visualise this relationship as content extends below the viewport.
