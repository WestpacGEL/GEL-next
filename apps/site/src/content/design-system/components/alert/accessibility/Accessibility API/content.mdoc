- A `<span aria-label="{ALERT_LOOK}">`: Provides a label that describes the Alert icon
- A `<role="img" focusable="false">`: Prevents the Alert icon SVG element from being traversed by browsers that map the SVG to the ‘group’ role and from unnecessarily receiving focus in Internet Explorer (IE)
- A `<span aria-hidden="true">`: Prevents the close button icon from being announced; it is labeled by the parent button
