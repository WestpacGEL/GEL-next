- Avoid formatting alert text.
- Don’t overuse alerts as this can diminish their effect and can make an experience feel broken.
- Alerts shouldn't be used for marketing messaging as other critical messages will be ignored through learned behaviours.
- Don’t use the reserved colour palette for anything other than alert message components.
- Don’t alter the colours or tints that make up each of the alert message components or use additional colours within the alert message.
- Don’t alter the borders colour, radius etc
- Avoid making alerts too complex. They’re only intended to be simple feedback messages.
