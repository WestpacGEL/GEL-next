Alerts are intentionally designed to differ from the UI content which is typically styled using the brands colours etc. Alerts are not intended to be part of the brand, rather they exist as a separate graphic style which (if used correctly) gives them more emphasis and allows customers to understand the difference between content and messaging.

Alerts convey meaning through colour and icons using a combination of carefully designed accessible colour and tint combinations. This cross-brand, contextual colour palette, called Reserved colours is for alert messaging only.
