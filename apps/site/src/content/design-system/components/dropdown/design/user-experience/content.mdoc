The Dropdown is a highly configurable component and is useful if space is at a premium. Triggered on click/tap it can hold links, switches, checkboxes etc. Sub headings can also be used to separate content in the dropdown.

Use a button dropdown as a way for your user to choose from a list of actions.

Although a button dropdown saves on screen space it does mean the action you want the user to perform is hidden behind an interaction ie a dropdown. Where possible, surface actions and choices at the page or screen level for discoverability and faster completion of tasks.
