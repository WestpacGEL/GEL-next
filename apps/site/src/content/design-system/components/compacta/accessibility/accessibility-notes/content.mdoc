All components comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and Success Criteria. These fall under the [four principles of accessibility](/accessibility/design-system-accessibility) – Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust. Below are some specific ways in which this component follows these principles:

### Operable

In order to assist screen reader users in determine which ‘compacta’ they are viewing an associated number is required. This is kept at the UI level for those who may use a combination of magnifier and screen reader.

Compactas are accessible components and must have numerical signifiers to aid screen reader users navigate and contextualise as well as those who use zoom tools or a combination of both.

The left-aligned placement of the 'Add another' and 'Remove' buttons is also an accessibility consideration for users who rely on zoom functionality, ensuring they can easily locate these controls without needing to search across the screen.
