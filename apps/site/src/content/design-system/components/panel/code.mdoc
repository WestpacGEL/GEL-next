      confusedly heaped and tangled; in front, a great space of quiet fields, hemmed by lines of hedges black on the
      snow, and, far ahead, a glint of the familiar old river, while the wintry sun hung red and low on the horizon. The
      Otter, as knowing all the paths, took charge of the party, and they trailed out on a bee-line for a distant stile.

      grimly set in vast white surroundings; simultaneously they turned and made swiftly for home, for firelight and the
      familiar things it played on, for the voice, sounding cheerily outside their window, of the river that they knew
      and trusted in all its moods, that never made them afraid with any amazement.
