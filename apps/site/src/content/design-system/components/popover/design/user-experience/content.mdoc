Popovers can retain helpful information to supplement a task or function. However, we don't recommend you hide critical information in popovers. Always surface important or critical information on the page or screen so itâ€™s discoverable and not hidden behind an interaction.

The popovers purpose is to show only short snippets of un-styled text, they should not contain text styling, links or buttons. Their most common usage is for [Help text](/guides/help-text).

Be wary of how popovers are used on mobile devices, or how they would work when users are using browser zoom or ZoomText to access your content. Popovers can obscure other content or functions, and be difficult to show reliably at smaller screen sizes. Alternatively, consider using a collapsible element or modal.

We recommend only using popovers when absolutely necessary, to consider the language you are using, and try to word things in such a way as to not require supplementary text.
