These popovers can appear with or without a heading. For accessibility reasons our popovers are designed to only be dismissed by re-selecting the element that triggered them, using the close button, or pressing the Escape key.

```tsx
<div><h4 className="typography-body-10 text-text-muted italic mb-3">Icon</h4>
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <p>With heading</p>
  <Popover
    heading="Heading"
    content="Small overlays of content for housing secondary information. These are often used to provide explanatory information
    for complex ideas."
    icon={() => <HelpIcon look="outlined" color="hero" />}
  />
  <p>Without heading</p>

    for complex ideas."
