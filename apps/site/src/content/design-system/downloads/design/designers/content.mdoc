### **Brand fonts**

Check the [Masterbrand Guidelines](https://intranet.westpacgroup.com.au/wbg/tools-and-resources/references/brand-guidelines) to understand how to use brand fonts effectively. Never use a font without confirmation that you have the correct licence in place.

Designers using other software can send a request for approval to [brand@westpac.com.au](mailto:brand@westpac.com.au).
