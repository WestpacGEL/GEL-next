  Our global visual language is shared across all our brands. We have a library
  of carefully crafted user interface icons for use in our designs. This article
  discusses the iconography design principles and provides usage guidelines to
  ensure that we design icons consistently and use them correctly. For
  information about embedding, sizing and styling icons please refer to the
  Design System Iconography.
