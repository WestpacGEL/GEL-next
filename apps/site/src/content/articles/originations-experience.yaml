description: >-
  Originations is the application process for all personal and business
  products. After thorough analysis and customer research,  we’ve created
  conventions that we apply to our projects. These conventions use our CX
  principles and standards, meet our compliance  commitments, and create
  consistency across our digital channels. The originations conventions include
  a sequence and reusable patterns.  By using these conventions, projects can
  replicate what works, so there’s no need to reinvent the wheel every time.
