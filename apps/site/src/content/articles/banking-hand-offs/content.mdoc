Use this pattern when your experience transitions from one platform to another.

## Whatâ€™s happening here?

When a process involves multiple technology platforms, the customer may experience a moment of waiting while the new platform screen appears, such as from a native iOS or Android online banking application to a web page. This pattern describes the various loading states required depending on where they are coming from or going to.

## Why do we do it this way?

### We're putting the customer first

Communicating to the customer what is happening on screen helps keep them informed and helps alleviate any frustration they may feel about having to wait.

## Where does it sit in the experience?

This pattern is displayed when the customer is moving from one process to another onto a different technology platform.
