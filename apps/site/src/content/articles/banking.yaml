  Digital banking is a critical need for our customers. It allows them to access
  their accounts and perform transactions 24/7, providing convenience and
  flexibility.   Through analysis and research, we have created digital banking
  patterns and guidelines that put our customers at the heart of our
  experiences.  They incorporate the CX principles and standards, meet our
  compliance commitments, and create consistency across our digital channels. 
  By using these patterns, projects can replicate what works, so there’s no need
  to reinvent the wheel.
