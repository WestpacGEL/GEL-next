## We are customer centred

We put the customer at the centre of everything we do and so we take a customer centric approach when designing and delivering our digital products and services.

- Design the right thing - explore customer problems to solve and opportunities to add value to our customers
- Design the thing right - use common tools to ensure individual projects across the organisation deliver on brand and connected customer experiences optimised for the digital channel

## What are the benefits of the GEL Design System?

By promoting the re-use of interface design and code, our business can invest more time and resources on activities that will provide the highest value to our customers; optimising the customer value proposition, service design, conversation design and process re-engineering for example.

The GEL Design System frees up time to ‘design the right thing’ in the discover phase of new digital products and services and provides the tools that our project teams need to ‘design the thing right’ during delivery.

Made up of elements, components, patterns, templates, and frameworks the design system can deliver scalable multi-brand solutions, faster.&nbsp;

Using the design system significantly reduces build cost, reduces risk (technically and for accessibility), as well as allowing solutions to go to market faster.
