## Research in human centred design: Building the foundation

In the constantly evolving landscape of design and technology, user experience (UX) research is the cornerstone of creating impactful and meaningful digital products. As these products continue to evolve, it quickly becomes evident that UX research is not just a component of the design process, but rather the very foundation of its success.

## Understanding customer behaviour for informed design decisions&nbsp;

UX research is more than just a step; it's a philosophy. By delving into customer behaviour, needs, and motivations, we unlock valuable insights that drive our design decisions. These insights guide us towards crafting experiences that resonate, whether you're navigating our team's internal processes or seeking to understand our design approach from an external perspective.

## Empowering design decisions&nbsp;

Where consistency and coherence across diverse platforms are paramount, UX research guides us toward informed design decisions. By collecting and analysing data, we ensure that every component of the experience aligns seamlessly with users' mental models and expectations. This approach transcends aesthetic preferences and is rooted in genuine interactions.

## Enhancing accessibility and inclusivity&nbsp;

With Westpac's commitment to [Access and Inclusion](https://www.westpac.com.au/web-accessibility/), UX research sheds light on diverse user demographics, their unique needs, and potential barriers they might face. This knowledge empowers us to design experiences that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities; the embodiment of human-centred design in its truest form.

## Iterative refinement for optimal outcomes&nbsp;

Research is an iterative process that goes hand-in-hand with human centred design (HCD). By utilising both qualitative and quantitative insights and measuring the performance of our designs, we can refine and optimise experiences over time. This approach ensures that our work remains relevant and effective in a dynamic and evolving digital landscape.

## Mitigating risk and saving resources&nbsp;

UX research isn't just about designing pretty interfaces; it's a strategic tool. By understanding user behaviour and needs upfront, we minimise the chances of developing costly solutions that miss the mark. This proactive approach saves time, effort and resources in the long run.

## Building trust and loyalty&nbsp;

Trust is a currency in the digital realm and consistency is its foundation. Customer research aids in crafting experiences that resonate with customers across different touch-points, fostering a sense of familiarity and loyalty. When customers consistently encounter an intuitive and seamless experience, they develop a bond with the brand that transcends individual interactions.

## Preparing for what's next

Change is constant, and UX research is our guide to prepare us for emerging trends. By continuing to understand behaviours and preferences, we can anticipate changing needs, foresee future direction and continue delivering innovative solutions.&nbsp;

In conclusion, UX research isn't just a preliminary step in the design process; it's a fundamental step upon which the entire human centred design philosophy stands. In a landscape, where consistency, inclusivity, and innovation are paramount, UX research empowers us to create experiences that resonate deeply with customers, allowing us to deliver exceptional experiences.
