### Page sections

Each variation of the Sponsorship page pattern is split into sections. The sections are prioritised to align with the purpose of the page, primarily to help our customers understand what’s unique about the sponsorship.

There are mandatory sections that must be included to support our customers on their journey. There are also some optional sections to help our customers learn more about the sponsorship.

**Mandatory sections** – these drive the primary action you would like a customer to take. In order of importance these are:

- **Orientation** – provides a clear headline to introduce the sponsorship that entices the customer to continue reading. This uses a header block banner and may include the most important feature or headline for the sponsorship.
- **Details** – highlights the sponsorship and outlines the key points. Some sponsorships may need additional details to help a customer understand why Westpac is supporting the cause or event.
- **Value** – gives detailed information to help a customer understand why we’re backing the sponsorship and shows the benefits it can offer to their daily life, business, or event.
- **Action** – presents a clear next action for the customer and outlines the next steps, whether it is supporting the cause or making a donation.

**Optional sections** - these help a customer learn more about a sponsorship.

For sponsorships these may include:

- **Awareness** – highlights promotions related to the sponsorship.
- **Support** – provides answers to frequently asked questions.

## How do we want our customers to feel?
