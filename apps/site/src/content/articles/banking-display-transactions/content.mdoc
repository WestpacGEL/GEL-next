Use this pattern and its variants to display transaction information to customers when required.

## Whatâ€™s happening here?

Transaction information can be laid out differently, depending on where the customer is in the application. Each transaction can contain the following elements:

- **Transaction icon** - Logo or icon corresponding to transaction, e.g., merchant logo, category icon
- **Title** - Transaction title e.g., Transaction name, account name, payee name
- **Amount** - Amount related to the transaction, e.g., dollar amount, carbon amount, foreign currency amount
- **Supporting content** - Any other information that is relevant to transaction. This is dependent on where the transaction is being displayed, e.g., account number/BSB, card number, transaction category name, bill due date, payment status, running balance, balance supporting text etc.
- **Transaction type indicator** - Used to indicate information regarding that transaction type, e.g., PartPay repayment, repeat frequency
- **Extension** - Used to indicate additional information regarding that transaction that may require an action, e.g., Smart plan repayment

## Why do we do it this way?

### Real time

The transaction detail and its status is real-time, giving the customers the most up-to-date information available.

### Reduce load

Providing visual indicators (i.e. icons and logos) helps the customer to quickly scan a list to see either the source or the transaction of which type or group it belongs to.

## Where does it sit in the experience?

Transaction information is used throughout the entire online banking experience.
